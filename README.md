This is my optimized PaperMC config that I used. It is designed to get the most performance possible while not breaking farms and other vanilla mechanics.

The files in this repository are to be put in the config folder of your server.

Common side effects of the default PaperMC config may include breaking many farms, redstone changes, and patching well-known and used bugs such as TNT duping. This tries to eliminate these. After you update those settings, install [Chunky](https://modrinth.com/plugin/chunky) and pre-generate the chunks around the most used area of your server.
